# Using customer loyalty data to analyse and predict sales outcomes for Turtle Games through statistical modelling.

# Turtle Games: Loyalty, Segmentation, and Sales Insight

## Project overview

This project analyses customer data from Turtle Games, a fictional games and hobby retailer, to understand how customer loyalty is built, whether meaningful customer segments exist, and how loyalty relates to sales outcomes. Conducted as part of the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator, the analysis aims to generate actionable insight for marketing, retention, and product strategy, while also assessing the suitability of loyalty data for predictive modelling.

## Objectives

The analysis was guided by four key questions:
 • How loyalty points accumulate across the customer base
 • Whether distinct and actionable customer segments can be identified
 • What customer reviews reveal about sentiment and experience
 • Whether loyalty data is suitable for predictive modelling of customer value

## Analytical approach

To address these questions, the project applied a combination of descriptive analysis, statistical modelling, clustering, and natural language processing. Loyalty points were used as the primary outcome measure, as they represent cumulative customer value based on real purchasing behaviour. The analysis examined the drivers of loyalty, tested both regression-based and tree-based prediction models, explored natural customer groupings, and analysed review text to understand sentiment and recurring themes.

## Key findings

- Customer loyalty is highly unevenly distributed, with a relatively small proportion of customers contributing a disproportionate share of total loyalty value. Loyalty points show strong, explainable relationships with both spending behaviour and income, while demographic variables add little additional explanatory power once behaviour is taken into account.
- Clustering analysis revealed five meaningful customer segments, including a high-value, highly engaged group that contributes a large share of loyalty value despite its relatively small size, and an under-engaged but affluent segment representing a clear growth opportunity.
- Predictive models performed well for identifying high-value customers, demonstrating that loyalty behaviour is complex but highly predictable using data already available to the business.
- Analysis of customer reviews showed sentiment to be broadly positive across all segments, with frequent references to fun, enjoyment, gifting, and family experiences. Negative sentiment was mainly associated with usability, unclear instructions, quality concerns, and unmet expectations. Importantly, sentiment was broadly consistent across segments, suggesting that loyalty differences are driven more by engagement and spending behaviour than by emotional attitudes toward the brand.

## Business implications

The findings point to clear strategic priorities: protecting and growing the highest-value customers, activating under-engaged affluent customers through more targeted propositions, sustaining core customers through consistent loyalty programmes, and managing lower-value segments in a cost-effective way. Review analysis highlights opportunities to reduce dissatisfaction by improving clarity, usability, and quality, while reinforcing positive emotional themes in marketing and communications.
